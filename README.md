A rudimentary [Vroom](http://github.com/google/vroom) filetype plugin. Provides syntax files and basic settings
for vroom files.

**NOTE**: As of vim 7.4.384, these files have been merged into vim's upstream
runtime files. You only need this plugin if you're running an older version of
vim, or to receive future updates until they're merged into vim.
